                Space is a very interesting and unique place with a lot still unknown about it. Though people have not been in space for a very long time, our history and achievements in space so far have been extenive and amazing. There are hundreds of missions that allowed us to learn about space as a whole and there are many missions to come. Space is extremely large and is almost entirely unexplored and this mystery is what draws us out of the our shell of Earth into the sea of stars.

            <p class="paragraphs">I always had an interest in space from a young age and I talked with my grandparents about it a lot because they were alive during the peak of the space race. My interest in space is derived of my interest of the unknown and the mystery of space itself. (<a href="#img1cite">1</a>)</p>
